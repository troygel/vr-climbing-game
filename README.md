## A scenic VR rock climbing game made in Unreal Engine

This is a VR climbing game that I developed to practice making realistic landscapes in Unreal Engine. The best part about this game is the landscape and the terrain. I used World Machine to create the base topography and various grass and plant nodes to fill it out. 

The player starts on a flat part of the terrain and explores. The player, no matter which direction they venture towards, eventually encounters rocks that they must climb in order to get a better view.

I also wanted to experiment with making and animating tools so the player climbs with a grappling hook.

Wherever the grappling hook lands, the player is launched there. Views can be observed while the player is in flight.

Hope you like it.
